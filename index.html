                <h2>Spiritual father of Indian Nationalism.</h2>
                <p><b>Swami Vivekananda</b> (12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta , was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world,and the father of modern Indian nationalism who is credited with raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.</p>
                <p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru Ramakrishna and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent acquiring first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago at which he delivered his famous speech beginning with the words: "Sisters and brothers of America ..." while introducing Hinduism to Americans.He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament".</p>
                <p>While synthesising and popularising various strands of Hindu-thought, most notably classical yoga and (Advaita) Vedanta, Vivekananda was influenced by western ideas such as Universalism, via Unitarian missionaries who collaborated with the Brahmo Samaj.His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of idolatry,and a "streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta".He propagated the idea that "the divine, the absolute, exists within all human beings regardless of social status",and that "seeing the divine as the essence of others will promote love and social harmony".Via his affiliations with Keshub Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan,the Freemasonry lodge,the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj,and Sen's Band of Hope, Vivekananda became acquainted with Western esotericism.

                    He was also influenced by Ramakrishna, who gradually brought Narendra to a Vedanta-based worldview that "provides the ontological basis for 'śivajñāne jīver sevā', the spiritual practice of serving human beings as actual manifestations of God</p>
